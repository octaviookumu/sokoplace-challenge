A login page using React, TypScript, Node and GraphQL


I had managed to run the files locally but can't do so via netlify due to CORS restriction when I use the https://graphql-user-api.herokuapp.com link.
Would look for a fix for it if I get the time but here is what I've done so far.

As a solution when running locally, you could change the https://graphql-user-api.herokuapp.com links on to http://localhost:4000.

To run the frontend and backend concurrently, run the "npm run conc" command while in the root directory.

The login comes with a register, login and confirm functionality.
For any questions, feel free to reach out.
